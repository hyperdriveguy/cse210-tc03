CSE 210

## Carson Bush
I'm from Southern Arizona, but I am currently living near BYU-I as I transition from online to in-person classes.
My major is currently Applied Technology, but I wish to switch it to computer engineering after this semeseter.
I've geen using Github since I was 15 for my personal projects.
I also have a very solid foundation in Python and wish to branch out to lower level languages.
