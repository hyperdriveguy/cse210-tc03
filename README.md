## Bryndi Hellewell
I am from Orem, Utah but currently live in Idaho. 
I enjoy spending time with family and friends (playing games or just hanging out and talking), going for walks, playing sports, and listening to books or podcasts. 
I am passionate about self-care, self-compassion, and commitment to Christ. 

I just recently discovered an interest in programming and web development and I am excited to learn more!
