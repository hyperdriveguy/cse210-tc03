## Bryndi Hellewell
I am from Orem, Utah but currently live in Idaho. 
I enjoy spending time with family and friends (playing games or just hanging out and talking), going for walks, playing sports, and listening to books or podcasts. 
I am passionate about self-care, self-compassion, and commitment to Christ. 

I just recently discovered an interest in programming and web development and I am excited to learn more!


## Carson Bush
I'm from Southern Arizona, but I am currently living near BYU-I as I transition from online to in-person classes.
My major is currently Applied Technology, but I wish to switch it to computer engineering after this semeseter.
I've geen using Github since I was 15 for my personal projects.
I also have a very solid foundation in Python and wish to branch out to lower level languages.
